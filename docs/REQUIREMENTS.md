# Requirements

This document describes requirements to be able to run module
and its tests. Note that latest software versions were used at the time of writing
this document, so if some bug is found with using particular versions, it should
be fixed and/or noted in this document.

## Operating systems

The module is designed for Linux/Unix development/usage only.
If you need to develop from Windows you can use the included [devcontainer setup for VScode](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/containers-tutorial)
and run the examples the same way but then from then `examples/basic_flow_devcontainer` folder.

If there is a need to build the module container to check interactions between modules etc,
Linux and MacOS should work fine and on Windows [WSL(2)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10) can be used.
In WSL2 you can easily share the docker host between Windows and the WSL2 environment
by selecting the WSL2 backend in Docker Desktop settings.
In WSL1 you can achieve the same with [this](https://nickjanetakis.com/blog/setting-up-docker-for-windows-and-wsl-to-work-flawlessly) tutorial.
